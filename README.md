# CANBus

The aim of this project is to make a prototype of a CAN Bus to USB adapter for Linux/Windows-based machines. The CAN communication goes through a MCP 2515 chip which is connected to a RI5CY processor. The processor hosts a FreeRTOS kernel which provides a Virtual COM on the end-user machine.
